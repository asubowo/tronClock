Looks pretty cool running inside [eDEX](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui), it's a terminal emulator based on the movie UI.
Made it for a wall mounted display to show events from google calendar and other useful info, check it out here: http://log.exlercs.com/index.php/2019/07/31/tron-clock-and-a-dissected-monitor-for-displaying-it/



Complile using:
`gcc nclock.c -lncurses`
